// Objects
All objects have...
	• Identity: 
	Daniel's coffee mug  
	To separate from other objects
	
	• Attributes: 
	color, size, fullness
	To describe current state
	
	• Behaviors:
	fill(), empty(), clean()
	Things it can do

// Classes
Code-template for creating objects

Class components
	• Name(Type): 
	What is it? RoundCookie
	
	• Attributes(properties, data): 
	What describes it?
	weight, color, icing
	
	• Behaviors(operations, method):
	decorate() consume()

object = instance of a particular class

// A   P.I.E.

// Abstraction
Abstractions focuses on the essential qualities rather than specific  examples.

e.g. politician -> George Washington

Always discard unimportant qualities

// Encapsulation
Containing the elements of an object, not just keep them, but also protect them.

One principle: an object should not make anything about itself available except what is absolutely necessary for other parts of the application to work.

General rule: encapsulate as much as possible

// Inheritance
	• Base a new object or class on an existing one 
	• inherit the existing attributes and methods.

Good parts: 
code reuse, one change in superclass

// Polymorphism
Dynamic Poly (run-time)
	• Inheritance, abstract class, interface
	• Defining different classes used with the same interface

Static Poly(compile-time)
	• Overloading
Overload a method from the same class that can take different sets of parameters.


// Analysis, Design and Programming
5 steps
	1. Gather requirements.
	2. Describe the applications.
	3. Identify the main objects.
	4. Describe the interactions.
