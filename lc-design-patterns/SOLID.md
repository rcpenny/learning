SOLID principle

1. Single responsibility principle
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change.
2. Open-Close principle
Software entities should be open for extension, but close for modification.
3. Liskov substitution principle
Object in a program should be replaceable with instances of their subtypes without altering the correctness of that program.
4. Interface Segregation principle
Many client-specific interfaces are better than one general-purpose interface.
5. Dependency Inversion principle
One should depend upon abstractions, not concretions.
