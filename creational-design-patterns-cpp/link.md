## creational design pattern
- abstract the instantiation process


## Singleton	
- Ensure a class has only one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
- e.g. Like a president of a country

## Factory method
- Define an interface for creating an object, but let subclasses decide which class to instantiate. 
- Factory Method lets a class defer instantiation to subclasses.
- e.g. coffee machine -> mocha, esspreso, latte..
- create objects based on runtime parameters
